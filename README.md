# 🌌 FTRT-Cambrian Correlation Project: Cosmic Architecture Revealed

## ⚡ Vision Statement

**We stand at the threshold of understanding evolution not as a purely terrestrial phenomenon, but as a cosmic symphony—where planetary alignments, solar storms, and geomagnetic fluctuations conduct the orchestra of genetic mutation and biological transformation.**

This project architects a radical framework connecting celestial mechanics to the very code of life itself.
